                <h2 style="margin-top:0px;">What Is BB Glow?</h2>

                <p>Nano Brow is a permanent makeup cosmetic procedure that is less permanent than traditional cosmetic tattooing. The results typically last 1-3 years, depending on your skin type and skincare routine.</p>

                <p>A digital machine tool with fine needles is used for the procedure. After carefully measuring to determine placement and shape, each ‘hair’ stroke is gently etched into the skin. The pigment is chosen to match the natural or desired brow
                    colour, taking into consideration skin tone. The result is an incredibly natural, realistic set of brows.</p>

                <p>Nano Brow is perfect for anyone wanting to enhance their brows. Whether you have little to no brow, thinning or over-plucked brows, the results are beautifully realistic. With this technique we can achieve a powdered or ombre look.</p>

                <p>First touch up for Nano Brow: 4 – 8 weeks.</p>

                <h2 style="margin-top:0px;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">How long does Nano Brow Treatment take?</h3>

                <p>Usually Nano Brows are done over two sessions. The first takes two to three hours. In the first session, the brow is shaped and styled to the client’s preference, and pigment is applied. Four to six weeks later, the client returns for
                    the second session for touch-up. This takes one to two hours.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">Why is it necessary to do a touch up?</h3>

                <p>A perfecting appointment is required to add or correct any hairstrokes or shading that did not retain from the initial appointment. It also provides the artist an opportunity to determine whether the healed result colour should be darkened
                    further.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">Are Nano Brows painful?</h3>

                <p>The level of discomfort is relatively minor. Some clients describe it as the same sensation as tweezing two to three hairs at one time or a slight sunburn. Usually a topical anesthetic is used to numb the area and this provides more than
                    sufficient relief. Topical anesthetics are safe and may contain lidocaine, tetracaine and epinephrine. Redness and slight swelling in the area is common after the procedure. Tylenol may be used to also provide additional pain relief
                    if required.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">Are there any pre or post care instructions?</h3>

                <p>Prior to the start of your session, avoid alcohol, aspirin, ibuprofren and any vitamins for seventy-two hours. Sometimes these can have a thinning effect on the blood. Please also avoid tanning in order to allow your natural skin tone
                    to be assessed. A full list of precare and after care instructions are available in the resources section of our website menu.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">What are the risks and complications with Nano Brows?</h3>

                <p>Nano Brow is a form of tattoo, using single-use sterilized needle cartridges. As with all forms of tattoo there is a risk of infection where sanitary protocols are not followed, including incorrect reprocessing of equipment, areas, or
                    hand washing. Allergic reactions though extremely rare are possible with pigments, numbing agents and other creams. It is possible to perform a patch test a few days in advance of the procedure.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">Do you shave my eyebrows off?</h3>

                <p>No, not at all. No shaving or waxing is done to your brows. Instead Nano Brows simply add and gives shape to what you already have. No shaving required.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">How long do Nano Brows take to heal?</h3>

                <p>The initial stages of healing take about ten days. In that time any redness will fade and the initial darkness of the eyebrows will begin to lighten. Overall, the colour will lighten over approximately thirty days as it completely sets
                    in.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">Can the touch up be performed earlier than four weeks?</h3>

                <p>This is not recommended as the healing needs to be completed before the final results are visible. Final adjustments should only be performed after the initial work has stabilized.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">How Long Do Nano Brows Last?</h3>

                <p>Generally, Nano Brows can last six to 18 months, depending on a number of factors including skin type, age, and lifestyle. Touch ups are required annually.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">Who should not have Nano Brow procedures?</h3>

                <p>Those using accutane, or who have received Botox or filler injections within the past 2 weeks. Any acute inflammation, outbreaks or chronic skin disease. Any deep tanning or chemical peels within the last 2 weeks or anyone with allergies
                    to topical numbing creams. Pregnant or nursing clients should not receive nano brows. Anyone on blood thinning medications.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">What if I don't like the results of Nano Brows?</h3>

                <p>Carefully choose your practitioner. Compare the work of various artists before choosing. Discuss your expectations and desired outcome, including the shape, style, and colour you wish. Realize that faces are never perfectly symmetrical.
                    Adjustments may be made during the touch up appointment. Remember that Nano Brows will eventually fade away if touch ups are not performed.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">What is the difference between Nano and Microblading?</h3>

                <p>Microblading lasts several months less than nano, and is reserved for people with non-oily skin. Microblading is better for those who don’t want to commit as long to permanent makeup, or who do not have permanent makeup already. In many
                    ways nano is an upgrade, or a substitute for microblading and most microblading clients will eventually “graduate’ into nano brows over time. The separate techniques are suited to different skin types and results.</p>
