        <h2 style="margin-top:0px;">What Is Microblading? (The Meaning of Microblading)</h2>
        <p>Microblading is a cosmetic beauty service otherwise known as “eyebrow tattoo.” Adopting some of the same tools used in tattooing the eyebrow is either enhanced or restored entirely using a custom pigment and hand-held blade.</p>

        <p>The results last up to 18 months or longer, depending on lifestyle and skincare routine.</p>

        <p>This permanent makeup process is a little like surveying a land plot getting ready to construct a building. First, the eyebrows are measured, mapped and understood in the context of your other facial features: nose, eyes, forehead, and hairline.</p>

        <p>This exercise in eyebrow reconstruction is like brain surgery, but for your brows. Measure a thousand times, but cut just once.</p>

        <p>Your brow artist will spend the better part of 3 hours with you. First, you’ll discuss any concerns, goals and review your skin type. Next, your brow artist will measure and pencil draw the brow area and concept where your future brows will live.
            You’ll be involved all along the way with the help of a mirror and a vibrant ring light so that no hair is left unturned.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:0px;">Best Microblading Eyebrows in Ottawa</h2>

        <p>With microblading in Ottawa, a hand-held tool with a U-Blade containing fine needles is used for the procedure.</p>

        <p>Once the client has approved the brow design and agreed upon the pigments, each ‘hair’ stroke is gently etched (or trenched) into the skin.</p>

        <p>The pigment is chosen to match the natural or desired brow colour, considering, among many things, skin tone. The result is an incredibly natural, hyper-realistic set of brows.</p>

        <p>A brow treatment like this is perfect for anyone who wants to enhance their brows. Whether you have no hair at all, few hairs, thinning, or over-plucked brows, the results are beautifully realistic, and the most amazing things are possible with
            cosmetic tattoo.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:0px;">How Is Microblading Different Than Having Your Eyebrows Tattooed?</h2>

        <p>We tell our clients to treat all brow tattoo as though it is permanent – like a cosmetic tattoo – because it is a semi-permanent tattoo and here to stay for quite a while. But in reality, there is a distinction between tattoo and microblading.</p>

        <p>Microblading performed correctly targets the epidermal layer of the skin (the outermost layer). This procedure is very similar to receiving paper cut thinness and depth with deposits of pigment.</p>

        <p>Because the cuts are so shallow, the pigment is very susceptible to the sun’s rays and the usual rapid cellular turnover of the skin’s outermost layer. Your microbladed brows are here for a good time, not a long time. Eventually, as the body sheds
            the epidermal cells, the pigment goes away.</p>

        <p>The procedure, when performed correctly, means that the process shouldn’t cause any scarring because it is only a superficial permanent procedure. This also means that you should be able to microblade again in the future because the artist is
            not contending with scar tissue.</p>

        <p>If your brow artist goes too deep (to force a longer microblading lifecycle), this will result in scabs, and a blurred ashy look and scar tissue. This means that it will look terrible from the start, and you won’t be a candidate for future microblading.
            The best microblading is intentionally superficial, looks crisp, and doesn’t last long.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:0px;">What Makes Tattoos Permanent And Why Microblading Is Not?</h2>

        <p>Let’s dig deeper into this very important difference.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMuBif1mJz0">Wait. Here’s a video that will help!</a></p>

        <p>When receiving a traditional tattoo, a special machine with needles punches through the skin between 50 and 3,000 times per minute. The needles travel through the epidermis and allow the ink to seep deep into the dermis, where all the nerves,
            collagen fibres, blood vessels, and glands are.</p>

        <p>Each time the needle penetrates, it causes an individual wound that sends an alert to the body’s inflammatory process. This calls the immune system to the wound site to begin repairing the skin. This process is what makes tattoos permanent.</p>

        <p>There is more. Special cells called macrophages consume the invading material (pigments) to clean up the inflammatory mess. The macrophages travel back through the lymphatic system carrying the dye all the way back to the lymph nodes, but other
            macrophages get left behind in the dermis.</p>

        <p>When the straggling macrophages get stuck behind, there is no way to dispose of the pigment and the dyes inside of them remain visible through the skin.</p>

        <p>Initially, ink is deposited into the epidermis. As the skin heals, the damaged epidermal cells are shed and then replaced by new dye-free cells, with the top outermost layer peeling off like a healing sunburn. Complete epidermal regeneration happens
            in 2 to 4 weeks.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:0px;">Recap For Microblading</h2>

        <p>Microblading is superficial and deposits pigment only in the outer layers – the epidermis – (otherwise, in the dermis, you get nasty scarring and an ashy “washed out” look).</p>

        <p>For microblading to be truly permanent, dye would need to reach the dermis for the macrophages to ingest it and get left behind. It is impossible to get that deep with a microblading u-blade and still achieve hyper-realistic, crisp hair-like strokes.</p>

        <p>Thus, microblading hair strokes are better when placed close to the surface, and because the epidermis sheds every 2 to 4 weeks eventually, these pigments will become ejected over time.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:0px;">What Are My Alternatives to Microblading?</h2>

        <p>Increasingly popular and longer-lasting are Nano Brows. The approach is nearly the same, but with some important differences. Nano Brows are a great alternative especially for those with oily skin types.</p>

        <p>The nano device is like a tattoo machine – a needle with ink dipping up to a thousand times every minute into the skin.</p>

        <p>With Nano, there is less trauma because there is no trenching through the skin with a blade. There is, therefore, less scarring. Nano brows can last 18 months and longer, depending on lifestyle.</p>

        <p>If you’re not ready for permanent brows, then true Microblading is ideal for you by someone who knows the differences in depth. However, if you’re ready for a longer-lasting look with less frequent maintenance, then Nano Brows is best.</p>

        <p>Whether Microblading or Nano Brows, both services require occasional touch-ups, usually within the first year and after a year, respectively.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:0px;">How Long Does Microblading Take?</h2>

        <p>Eyebrow tattoo takes up to 3 hours. The first hour is taken up by the consultation, brow mapping, and colour selection. The next hour or two is dedicated to actually performing the service, mirror checks and making small adjustments as required.
            A second session is required within 4 to 6 weeks to touch-up any areas that did not retain.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:0px;">How Long Does Microblading Take To Heal?</h2>

        <p>The microblading healing process takes about 10 days to heal and up to 30 days for the colour to settle. By 30 days, it can easily be seen how much of the pigment will be retained, following which is the ideal time for a touch-up.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:0px;">Why Is It Necessary To Touch-Up Microblading?</h2>

        <p>Only once the initial microblading session has healed, and the colour has settled can the microblading technician determine whether the colour should be darker, and if any areas with poor retention should be redone.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:0px;">Can The Touch-Up Be Done Sooner Than 4 Weeks?</h2>

        <p>Performing a touch-up in less than four weeks is not recommended as the results have not healed, and it is impossible to know how the colour will settle.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:0px;">Is Microblading Painful?</h2>

        <p>When performed correctly by a qualified technician, microblading is not usually painful.

        </p>
        <h2 style="margin-top:0px;">How Long Does Microblading Last?</h2>

        <p>Microblading, if done correctly, shouldn’t last longer than 8 to 16 months.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:0px;">What Are The Precare Instructions For Microblading?</h2>

        <p>Before starting your microblading appointment, avoid caffeine, alcohol, aspirin, ibuprofen and any vitamins for seventy-two hours. Sometimes these have the effect of thinning your blood. Also, avoid tanning to allow your natural skin tone to be
            assessed.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:0px;">What Are The Best Microblading Aftercare Instructions?</h2>

        <p>When working with the right professional, it is rare to dislike the outcome of microblading. Some adjustments can be made to the shape and colour, but remember, your brows will eventually fade away anyway. Be sure to choose the right professional
            to avoid any unwanted outcomes.</p>

        <p>Microblading is one of the most popular and sought after services to recreate your natural hair and give you back that full brow. Brow hairs are important, and you must find a skilled artist who can step up to the challenge.</p>

        <p>Whether your goals are to look like Cara Delevingne or simply to add some more density to your existing brow, then you should find a microblading artist that is worthy of a life-long beauty partnership.</p>
