        <p>It’s a fact that the skin undergoes many changes and even trauma. There are many causes for the changes in our skin, including:</p>

        <li>
            Recreational or occupational injury
        </li>
        <li>
            Rapid weight gain in our body, e.g. moms who have given birth; weightlifters who have experienced sudden muscle growth, or fat storage (and those using Creatine)
        </li>
        <li>
            Self Harm Scars
        </li>
        <li>
            Surgery (Cosmetic Surgery, Plastic Surgery, Implants etc.)
        </li>

        <li>
            Vitiligo
        </li>

        <p>While some people love owning their look and may even show it off, some find that their stretch marks, scars, and pigmentation changes are distracting and get in the way of feeling confident. For others, their scars refer to a story that they
            don’t want to tell anymore.</p>

        <p>Everyone deals with this in their own way. If you’ve tried, and you’re ready to move on – to tell another story – and find a long-lasting solution, then camouflage tattoo might be for you.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">What Is Camouflage Tattoo?</h3>

        <p>Scar, stretch mark or Vitiligo camouflage tattoo uses a specialized technique that is nearly identical to traditional tattoo methods. Both the pigments and needle depth are very similar to common tattoo processes. The difference between camouflage
            and traditional tattoo is that traditional tattoo aims to create designs that stand out and contrast next to the skin, whereas camouflage tattoo aims to mask areas of the skin that stands out.</p>

        <p>Camouflage Tattoo is a form of “paramedical tattoo”, and it is an increasingly popular alternative to surgical and invasive medical procedures.</p>

        <p>In 2 to 3 hours and approximately 2 to 3 separate sessions, an electric machine with a fine precision needle is used for the procedure. After carefully mixing a selection of custom formulated pigments mixed specifically to match your skin, small
            dots are rapidly deposited into the dermis. The result: an incredibly natural and realistic continuation of your beautiful skin, masking unwanted scars, stretch marks, or Vitiligo.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">What Makes Tattoo Permanent?</h3>

        <p>Tattoos are permanent because of our body’s immune system. When pigment (foreign material) is introduced into or below the dermis, it triggers an immune system response. Whenever the needle penetrates the skin, it causes tiny wounds that result
            in our body, producing an inflammatory response and a signal to start repair. White blood cells (“macrophages”) rush to the site and attempt to consume the invading material and clean up the inflammation. The macrophages “gobble” up the pigment
            and carry it back to the lymph nodes through the lymphatic system. While some macrophages make it, many are left behind. With the lagging white blood cells stuck with bellies full of dye, they clump together. With no way to dispose of the
            pigment, the dyes inside of them remain visible through the skin. These visible pigments are what makes tattoos permanent.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">Who Is Camouflage Tattoo For?</h3>

        <p>Camouflaging for scars and stretch marks is perfect for:</p>

        <li>
            Anyone over 18
        </li>
        <li>
            Scars or stretch marks that have healed for at least 2 years
        </li>

        <li>
            Any colour or skin type
        </li>

        <li>
            Anyone who is not pregnant or breastfeeding
        </li>

        <p>If you have Vitiligo, scars, or stretch marks that are white and have healed for at least 2 years, you are a camouflage tattoo candidate.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">What Is The Difference Between Micropigmentation and Camouflage Tattoo?</h3>

        <p>The pigments used in camouflage tattoo are different from those used in micropigmentation. The pigments used in camouflage tattoo are insoluble, unlike those that are used in the micropigmentation that are, with time, absorbed by the body.</p>

        <p>The technique used in camouflage involves introducing pigment into the dermis with the aid of needles and pigments retained in the skin cells.</p>

        <p>By contrast, in micropigmentation, the pigments are deposited in the epidermis. The epidermis undergoes constant cellular renewal, which causes the pigment to disappear over time.</p>

        <p>Camouflage tattoo is therefore understood to be more permanent than micropigmentation.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">Is Camouflage Tattoo Permanent?</h3>

        <p>Because pigments used in camouflage tattoo are non-soluble, and because they are embedded into the dermis, they last much longer and should be expected as permanent.</p>

        <p>The pigments used in camouflage tattoo are also less sensitive to sun exposure and, they should not change.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">What Are Alternatives To Camouflage Tattoo?</h3>

        <p>For those who have considered surgery, skin grafting, or laser work, you may have been shocked at the price and the time commitment involved to complete all of the sessions necessary to resolve your concerns. As well, scar revision can be expensive
            and often require extensive travel for preliminary and follow-up consultations.</p>

        <p>Camouflage Tattoo is a great alternative to surgery and laser treatments due to its lower price point and more immediate results.</p>
