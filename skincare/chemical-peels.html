        <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">What Is A Chemical Peel?</h3>

        <p>AlumierMD chemical peels are skin- resurfacing procedures where controlled damage to the epidermis is created with the intention of removing the top layers of the skin. The peels will stimulate new smoother and younger looking skin to grow back
            and improve overall skin texture and tone.</p>

        <p>Skin peels are dated back to ancient Egypt were Cleopatra was known to use sour milk to improve the appearance of her skin. The sour milk contained lactic acid, an alpha hydroxy acid, which rejuvenates the skin. In Roman times, the women would
            use tartaric acid, found in grapes to exfoliate their skin. Other treatments to even out the skin tone would include using substances such as sulphur, mustard and limestone.</p>

        <p>So you can see, skin peels have a long history.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">How Can Chemical Peels Benefit The Skin?</h3>

        <p>Chemical peels are the secret to perfect skin. By casting off dull surface cells, they improve acne prone skin, discolouration, fine lines, wrinkles, skin texture, firmness and reduce the appearance of pore size.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">How Often Can You Get A Chemical Peel?</h3>

        <p>Chemical peels can be done every three to four weeks. However if you suffer from acne you can do a peel every two weeks until you find the expected results. Most people buy a series of four or five peels up front to achieve the treatment results
            wanted.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">How To Prepare For A Chemical Peel?</h3>

        <p>It is important that you do not exfoliate for at least one week prior to your treatment. You should stop using anti-aging products or anti-acne medications. Products like these will impact how your skin will tolerate the peel. Stay hydrated and
            please do not book a peel too close to an important event. Unless you are doing one of the light peels.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">What To Expect During Your Chemical Peel Appointment</h3>

        <p>You will experience an itching or tingling sensation during the treatment. You will have mild sensitivity or redness for up to four days post treatment. You will experience mild peeling on your forehead, chin and nose.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">On What Areas of the Body Are Chemical Peels Used?</h3>

        <p>Chemical peels are usually performed on the face, but may also be used on the neck, décolleté, back (for acne) and hands (hyperpigmentation).</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">What Are The Common Peeling Agents Used?</h3>

        <p>Some common peeling ingredients include alpha hydroxy acids, beta hydroxy acids, trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and retinol. Alpha hydroxy acids include glycolic acid (originally from sugar cane), lactic acid (originally from milk), malic acid (originally
            from apples and pears), tartaric acid (originally from grapes) and mandelic acid (originally from bitter almonds). Salicylic acid (related to aspirin) is the only beta hydroxy acid.</p>

        <p>Not all peels are created equal, and one peel type doesn’t suit all. Certain ingredients may be more effective for treating acne, while others may be more successful in treating hyperpigmentation or the signs of aging.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">Enzymatic Peel</h3>

        <p>Like a chemical peel, an enzyme peel is a very gentle treatment used to improve skin texture and appearance.</p>

        <p>Enzymes are applied to the skin, which loosen the connections between dead skin cells, inducing exfoliation and stimulating new cell growth. This process causes superficial layers of dead skin to peel off, revealing a smoother and more radiant
            complexion. Enzyme peels both nourish and exfoliate the skin and are usually made with fruit enzymes. The most popular fruit enzymes are papain, found in papayas, and bromelain, found in pineapple.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">Glow Peel</h3>

        <p>The Glow Peel offers the same benefits as the Power Glow, at half the strength. This peel can also be customized by the number of layers applied. Much like the Power Glow Peel, the down time is minimal. Ideal for most skin types.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">Aha Duo</h3>

        <p>AHA peels work by reducing sulfate and phosphate groups from the surface of corneocytes to decrease corneocyte cohesion leading to exfoliation of epidermal cells.</p>

        <p>This peel contains lactic and glycolic acid to target multiple skin concerns including fine lines and wrinkles, discolouration, sun damage and large pores. Ideal for most skin types. Best for mature skin.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">BHA 20</h3>

        <p>Salicylic acid peels are lipid soluble allowing deeper penetration into the follicle. As well as exfoliating, salicylic acid works as both a keratolytic and comedolytic agent by causing cells of the epidermis and in the follicle to shed, clearing
            the pores and allowing room for new cell growth. In addition, salicylic acid has anti-inflammatory properties and is able to neutralize bacteria at low percentages. These properties make salicylic acid ideal for oily and acne-prone skin.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">Power Glow Peel</h3>

        <p>A powerful, brightening, resurfacing peel that improves the signs of aging and hyperpigmentation with minimal downtime. This formula is effective in minimizing the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, age spots and uneven skin tone. This peel can
            be customized in strength by the number of layers applied. Recommended for lighter skin types. Ideal for more resilient skin types.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">Renew 30</h3>

        <p>This peel uses lactic acid to exfoliate dead skin cells and boost skin turnover. It targets fine lines and wrinkles, discolouration, sun damage and large pores. Suitable for most skin types. Best for dehydrated and sensitive skin.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">What To Expect From A Professional AlumierMD Chemical Peel?</h3>

        <p>Beautiful skin doesn’t happen overnight. A single chemical peel can provide the immediate effect of bright and radiant skin. However, more significant results in treating textural issues, fine lines and inflamed acne take time. We recommend a
            series of 3-5 treatments for best results.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">What Are Alternatives to Professional Chemical Peels?</h3>
