        <h2 style="margin-top:0px;">MICRONEEDLING Q and A</h2>
        <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">What is Microneedling?</h3>

        <p>Microneedling is a popular cosmetic skincare procedure that involves a machine pen containing up to 12 surgical grade pins that move in rapid succession creating fine perforations within the epidermis.</p>

        <p>This particular treatment with IVONNE is uniquely combined with AnteAGE next-generation stem cell cytokine serum which:

            <li>
                Offers the least inflammation over all other regenerative skin treatments
            </li>
            <li>
                Uses the body’s natural healing mechanism by leveraging the power of growth factors
            </li>
            <li>
                Aims to offer a gentle and natural way to reverse or slow down the effects of aging, temporarily halting, stopping and arresting inflammation in the skin.</li>

            <p>Microneedling is perfect for anyone wanting to address fine lines, wrinkles or sun/aging spots or to resolve some scar tissue.</p>

            <p>Recommended 3-6 treatments and use of home serum and accelerator for best results.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">How Long Does It Take To See Results From Microneedling?</h3>

            <p>Many clients see results after only the first treatment. The results will vary from client to client and are based on overall skin health. Typically clients will see the benefits within 1 to 2 weeks of having received Microneedling.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">What Does Microneedling Do For Your Skin?</h3>

            <p>Microneedling is used to improve the skin’s complexion and resolve acne scarring, fine lines and wrinkles, loose skin, skin texture, pore size, brown spots, stretch marks, and pigment issues. It’s also known as skin needling, collagen induction
                therapy (CIT), or percutaneous collagen induction. Microneedling gently stimulates the skin to support and inspire collagen and elastin production, resulting in thicker more youthful looking skin.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">Is Microneedling Safe?</h3>

            <p>Microneedling is only minimally invasive and at IVONNE we aim to work only between the junction of the dermis and the epidermal layer, encouraging absorption of Hyaluronic Acid and Growth Factors. Microneedling is safe for those who are in
                good health, not pregnant or breastfeeding. At IVONNE we use a licensed Class 2 Medical Device registered with Health Canada.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">How Many Times Do You Need Microneedling?</h3>

            <p>Microneedling can safely be performed once every 4 to 6 weeks. Certain conditions like scar reduction may need 4 or more treatments where collagen induction may require only 3 treatments. The number of treatments will vary from client to client
                however it is most common to perform 6 treatments to start. For skin rejuvenation it is routine to start with 6 treatments then perform 2-3 treatments every 12 to 18 months.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">Are The Results of Microneedling Permanent?</h3>

            <p>The microneedling process is permanent for some conditions like treatment of scars, and it is expected that these do not return. However, using microneedling to resolve lines and wrinkles is only temporary as the skin will continue to age
                over time and lines and wrinkles will return.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">How Long Does A Microneedling Session Last?</h3>

            <p>A routine microneedling session can last for 1 to 1.5 hours. This provides an opportunity to cleanse, numb the skin and to perform the procedure. This will also include a consultation or an update to your file.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">How does Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) compare to Stem Cell Cytokine Solution during microneedling?</h3>

            <p>Platelet Rich Plasma includes hundreds of cytokines, many of which are pro-inflammatory. Our opinion remains that PRP incites a significant pro-inflammatory response when used in conjunction with microneedling, and that this may be something
                to avoid, especially in individuals prone to hyperpigmentation or fibrosis. On an occasional basis, most people should tolerate PRP without problem or difficulty. However, the amount of cytokines and growth factors declines with age, which
                is why healing times are longer the older we grow. This means that most patients seeking these treatments will not have the same concentration of anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors in their plasma that are contained in AnteAGE
                Microneedling Solution.</p>
